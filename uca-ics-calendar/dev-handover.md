# Dev Handover

## Overview
This handover summarizes the recent work on the UCA ICS Calendar plugin, the current feature set, and suggested next steps. It also captures what was last changed so another developer can pick up smoothly.

## Completed Work
- Feeds UI: Replaced textarea with a repeater for Label + URL and an Enable checkbox; maintains backward compatibility.
- Label-based shortcodes: Shortcode `feeds` can reference saved labels; labels are required and unique; admin shows validation notices for missing/duplicate rows.
- Caching/cron: Preserved; no functional changes.
- Tabbed settings: Added tabs for General Settings, Feed Details, and Styling.
- Styling system:
  - CSS variables in frontend; compact mode; accent/badge/title colors; card/item borders and backgrounds.
  - Spacing controls (padding/margins/gap) for card, event, title, date, badge, description, location.
  - List/Grid view with per-breakpoint columns (desktop/tablet/mobile) and scale factors for tablet/mobile that adjust font sizes and spacing.
  - Live preview in the Styling tab using the same CSS and inline vars.
- Color picker: Upgraded to WP Color Picker with palettes, always-visible value inputs; later removed transparency control per request (now hex-only in UI).
- Elements control: New Styling → Elements accordion with drag-and-drop ordering (when, summary, location, desc) and visibility toggles, plus badge toggle. Frontend output respects order/visibility.
- Cross-tab save fixes: Sanitization now preserves unsent settings when saving a specific tab.
- README: Added comprehensive README with purpose, how it works, usage, styling notes, and limitations.

## Current Behavior
- Feeds
  - Repeater rows saved to `uca_ics_settings[feeds_list]` with `label`, `url`, and `enabled`.
  - Shortcode can specify labels or URLs; labels map to saved feeds; settings are used when shortcode omits `feeds`.
- Styling
  - Settings saved under `uca_ics_settings[...]` generate inline CSS variables applied to `.uca-ics-calendar`.
  - Grid uses `--uca-ics-cols` with per-breakpoint overrides and scale factors in CSS.
  - Color inputs are hex-only in UI; rgba is still accepted by sanitizer but UI normalizes to hex on edit.
- Elements
  - Order stored in `uca_ics_settings[elements_order]` (CSV of `when,summary,location,desc`).
  - Visibility stored in `uca_ics_settings[show_*]` and used in frontend rendering.

## Pending / Nice-to-Have
- Live preview for Elements: Reflect element visibility and order changes instantly in the admin preview without saving.
- Feed repeater UX: Add per-row hidden inputs for the Enabled checkbox (explicit 0/1) to avoid ambiguity on submission.
- Styling presets: Add preset buttons (Minimal/Comfortable/Spacious) and a “Reset section” action.
- Optional stricter color sanitize: If desired, restrict saved colors to hex-only to match the current UI.
- Screenshots/docs: Update README with screenshots of the new settings and examples of list/grid, elements ordering, etc.
- Recurrence support: Expand ICS parsing to handle RRULE/EXDATE (currently out of scope; noted as limitation).

## Last Worked On
- Elements accordion (drag-and-drop + visibility) and frontend rendering to honor order/visibility.
- Color picker UX change to hex-only (removed transparency), while keeping improved picker and always-visible value inputs.

## Key Files Touched
- Plugin bootstrap: `uca-ics-calendar.php`
- Frontend:
  - `includes/class-uca-ics-calendar.php` — shortcode rendering, element order/visibility, styling inline CSS hookup.
  - `assets/css/frontend.css` — CSS variables and responsive behavior.
- Admin:
  - `includes/class-uca-ics-admin.php` — settings tabs, repeater, styling fields, elements accordion, sanitization, enqueue.
  - `assets/js/admin.js` — repeater JS, styling live-preview, color pickers (WP), sortable elements.
  - `assets/css/admin.css` — styling for settings UI, accordions, preview, elements list.
- Helpers:
  - `includes/helpers.php` — ICS parsing helpers, feed collection, inline CSS builder, color sanitize helper.
- Docs:
  - `README.md` — purpose, usage, configuration, limitations.

## Quick Start for the Next Dev
- Where to test: Settings → ICS Calendar → Styling tab (General / Elements / other sections); Styling tab preview reflects changes.
- Minimal end-to-end test:
  1) Add 2–3 feeds in General tab (repeater). 2) Use `[ics_calendar]` on a page. 3) Toggle Styling → Elements visibility, reorder, and verify frontend. 4) Try grid with columns and scale in preview and on frontend.
- If issues with preview styling: Ensure `assets/css/frontend.css` is enqueued in admin (done in `enqueue()`) and inline CSS is added via `uca_ics_style_inline_css()`.
